{partner-product-name} enables you to import and test your running EKS workloads and identify vulnerabilities in their associated images and configurations that might make those workloads less secure. Once imported, Snyk continues to monitor those workloads, identifying additional security issues as new images are deployed and the workload configuration changes.

This Quick Start is for developers, devops, security teams, or any role within an organization building, deploying and maintaining applications on Amazon EKS.
